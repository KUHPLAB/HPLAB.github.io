				<title>Logo revision</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;The previous logo symbolized EEG and Behavioral measurement.&lt;br /&gt;
However, that contained too many lines, some members preferred simple style.&lt;br /&gt;
In reflection of the members, I changed logo to make looks simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please give some attention to our new logo!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>New HPLAB Github page</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I made new Github page by using jekyll. This homepage is easy to manage students’ profile, publications, news and notice. If you learn Git and Markdown little bit, it is really easy to manage the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I designed lab logo. The logo symbolizes the brain (including EEG, please see tiny electric wave in logo!) and human behavior performance (Stopwatch).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you like a style of new website. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Research Assistant Recruitment 2019</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Human Performance Lab&lt;br /&gt;
Korea University&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lab director: Prof. Yang Seok Cho&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.General Lab Information&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research in Human Performance lab takes a cognitive and neuroscientific approach for investigating the nature of human selective attention, cognitive control, and response selection. As top-down factors including current task goals, working memory, and reward play significant roles in guiding attention, members of the lab conduct research on how each factor may change one’s perception and cognition. The lab adopts both behavioral and neurophysiologic measures that include fMRI and ERP techniques in conducting experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.Criteria for Eligibility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are interested in and eager to learn more about visual attention, cognitive control, and response selection are welcome to apply for our research assistant positions. What Professor Cho looks for in a candidate is someone who is planning to apply for a higher degree in cognitive psychology. Students who are in their Junior or Senior years of college are preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Quality of Work Expectations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research assistants are expected to spend time in the lab for 8 hours a week. We expect them to spend quality time in the lab by strictly attending to weekly study meeting, helping graduate students run on-going experiments, and doing programming or statistics assignments. Working as a research assistant in the lab will help you earn advanced knowledge and techniques on cognitive psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Contact Information&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please contact Prof. Cho (yscho_psych@korea.ac.kr) before you send your application form. After filling out your application, please send it to one of Prof. Cho’s graduate students(delukamine@naver.com).&lt;br /&gt;
